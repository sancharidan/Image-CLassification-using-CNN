# Image-CLassification-using-CNN
Classification of images in CIFAR 10 dataset uding a deep convolutional neural network architecture. The backpropagation formulae have been derived for the CNN and accordingly the algorithm developed. Mini batch gradient descent is used to learn the biases and filters of the network.
